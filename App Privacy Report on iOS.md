## Why install App Privacy Report on iOS?



[App Privacy Report](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212958) appeared on Apple devices with iOS 15.2 and iPadOS 15.2. It gives details about how often apps access your dataâ€”like your location, camera, microphone, and more. You can also see information about each app's network activity and website network activity, as well as the web domains that all apps contact most frequently.
