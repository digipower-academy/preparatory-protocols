# Getting your data from LinkedIn


To get data from LinkedIn you have two options. To use their download portal to access standard data, use the Download Portal instructions below. 




1. In Account, Under your picture Me → Settings & Privacy  (or direct link https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/) → Get a copy of your data

2. A menu with buttons allows to download either the complete archive, or a selection. It is suggested to simply download the entire dataset with "Download larger data archive" and press Request archive

3. Within few hours, you should receive an e-mail titled "The first installment of your LinkedIn data archive is ready!". This leads to a first archive containing connections, contacts, messages, and profile information.

4. Within 48 hours, a second mail should arrive, titled, "Your full LinkedIn data archive is ready!". The link stays valid for 72 hours. You can always request a new archive every 2 hours.
