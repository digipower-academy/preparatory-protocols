# Getting your data from Google



To get data from Google you have two options. To use their download portal ("Google Takeout") to access standard data, use the Download Portal instructions below. For more complex or bespoke requests, use the Subject Access Requests process further down this page.



## Download Portal Instructions



1. In a web browser on your main computer, go to https://takeout.google.com/

2. If you are logged into the wrong account, or not logged in, please login to the correct Google account and return to this page.

3. We are now going to select a set of Google data which will be quick to download and avoid larger items such as Mail, Drive, Photos, YouTube Videos etc. Start by clicking "Deselect All" on the right hand side near the top of the Select Data to Include window

4. Now click the tickbox next to the following rows to **add** them to your selection. Don't worry if some of these don't appear for you, it just means you don't use them so can ignore. You can also omit any that you don't wish to see the data for.

6. For the following entries, you need to change the download format to one that will be better structured for use in viewing tools like ours. This is done by clicking the leftmost button in the row (usually says "HTML format" or "Multiple Formats") and using dropdowns to change any options to JSON format:



    - Google Play Books -> Change 'Play Books Metadata' HTML to JSON

    - Google Play Games Services -> Change all 7 HTML dropdowns to JSON

    - Google Movies and TV -> Change 'Movies & TV Data' from CSV to JSON

    - Location History -> Change format from KML to JSON

    - My Activity -> Change 'Activity Records' format from HTML to JSON <-- **IMPORTANT**

    - Profile -> Change 'Inactive Account Manager settings' from HTML to JSON

    - YouTube -> Change 'Viewing history' from HTML to JSON



7. For YouTube, also click the right hand button in the row "All YouTube Data included" and UNCHECK the 'videos' checkbox. This is very important if you have ever uploaded a video to YouTube.

8. Click the blue "Next Step" button.

9. This has queued your download. Check details below on how to retrieve it.

Before we leave, we need to kick off another download. This one is done separately so as not to delay the main download. The goal is to get access to Access Log Activity data without interfering with the other download.

10. At the bottom of the screen in step 9, press the button "Create another Export".

11. Start by clicking "Deselect All" on the right hand side near the top of the Select Data to Include window

12. Now click the tickbox next to the following row (usually the very first one): Access Log Activity

13. Scroll down and click the blue "Next Step" button.

14. This has queued your download. Check details below on how to retrieve it.



TO RETRIEVE YOUR DOWNLOADS



15. You may or may not receive an email or Android notification when each of the two downloads is ready. Please come back and visit https://takeout.google.com/takeout/downloads after a few hours or a day, and both downloads should be available. Please download both.
